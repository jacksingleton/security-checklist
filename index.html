      <p><strong>[ ] My hard drive is encrypted</strong></p>

<p><em>why?</em></p>

<p>If your hard drive is not encrypted anyone that finds it lying around can access all of your data with minimal effort -- even if your device has a password.</p>

<p><em>how?</em></p>

<p><strong>[ ] My firewall is enabled</strong></p>

<p><em>why?</em></p>

<p>When your firewall is enabled it will prevent many attempts from remote attackers trying accessing your laptop.</p>

<p><em>how?</em></p>

</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>[ ] I have lock screens on all of my devices, and they lock automatically</strong></p>

<p><em>why?</em></p>

<p>Chances are you don't take your laptop with you to the restroom. A lock screen will prevent someone from walking up and tinkering with your device when you step away.</p>

<p><em>how?</em></p>

<p><strong>[ ] I have enabled automatic updates</strong></p>

<p><em>why?</em></p>

<p>New security problems are found in software every day. Enabling automatic updates allows your software to fix itself as soon as a problem is discovered. </p>

<p><em>how?</em></p>

</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>[ ] I am using a password manager</strong></p>

<p><em>why?</em></p>

<p>If you use the same or similar passwords on lots of different sites, attackers likely know your password! A password manager is the only way to use a completely unique password on every site.</p>

<p><em>how?</em></p>

<p>[ ] I have antivirus installed on my Mac and/or PC
why? Contrary to popular belief, it's possible to get viruses on Macs as well as PCs.
how?</p>

<ul>

</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>[ ] I have enabled two factor authentication whenever possible (especially for email and social media)</strong></p>

<p><em>why?</em></p>

<p>Even if you use a password manager, there are ways attackers can steal your password. Two factor authentication requires an attacker to have physical access to your phone in addition to knowing your password.</p>

<p><em>how?</em></p>

<p><a href="http://lifehacker.com/5938565/heres-everywhere-you-should-enable-two-factor-authentication-right-now">http://lifehacker.com/5938565/heres-everywhere-you-should-enable-two-factor-authentication-right-now</a></p>

<p><strong>[ ] The "security questions" on all my accounts cannot be guessed or researched</strong></p>

<p><em>why?</em></p>

<p>Questions like "what is your mothers maiden name?" are easy for attackers to answer. </p>

<p><em>how?</em></p>

<p>Review these questions for all important accounts, especially email and social media accounts. Do not use any questions with publicly available answers. To be extra safe, use your password manager to save completely random answers. </p>

<p><strong>[ ] My email provider is appropriately trustworthy</strong></p>

<p><em>why?</em></p>

<p>In addition to valuable communications, email accounts often provide access to many other accounts via "forgot my password" functionality. You should trust your email provider not to compromise any account you sign up for with that email address!</p>

<p><em>how?</em></p>

<p>Consider using alternatives to corporate American email providers such as Gmail and Hotmail: <a href="http://www.prxbx.com/email/">http://www.prxbx.com/email/</a></p>
